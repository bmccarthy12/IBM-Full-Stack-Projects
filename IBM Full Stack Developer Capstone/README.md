# Final Capstone Project: Full-Stack Web Application for Car Dealership Reviews

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the IBM Full Stack Cloud Developer Professional Certificate. The goal was to develop and deploy a cloud-based full-stack web application that allows users to interact with car dealership data. The application provided functionalities for viewing dealerships, submitting reviews, and analyzing customer sentiments, all while demonstrating proficiency in backend, frontend, and deployment technologies.

---

## Objectives
- Build a fully functional full-stack web application using Django, React, and Python.
- Implement user authentication and session management for secure access.
- Integrate backend services for managing car dealership data, user reviews, and sentiment analysis.
- Deploy the application on IBM Cloud using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Set up continuous integration and delivery pipelines using GitHub Actions.

### Prework
- Created an IBM Cloud account and provisioned a Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service to analyze customer review sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).

### Module 1: Static Web Pages with Django
- Developed static pages for the website, including "About" and "Contact" pages.
- Configured a Django app and deployed the static pages to IBM Cloud.

### Module 2: User Management with Django and React
- Implemented user authentication using Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system.
- Created a user registration and login system with React for the frontend.
- Debugged and resolved issues in the logout functionality, ensuring browser compatibility.

### Module 3: Backend Services and Database Integration
- **API Development**:
  - Built REST API endpoints using Django to fetch dealership and review data.
  - Filtered dealership data by state or ID using query parameters.
- **Database Models**:
  - Designed Django models for managing car makes, models, and reviews.
  - Adjusted database schema to match backend service requirements.
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Deployed a Dockerized sentiment analyzer on IBM Cloud Code Engine.
  - Integrated the analyzer into backend services to provide sentiment scores for customer reviews.

### Module 4: Dynamic Pages with React
- Added dynamic React components for displaying dealership details and customer reviews.
- Developed a review submission page, enabling users to post feedback for specific dealerships.
- Synced backend API responses with React components to ensure seamless data rendering.

### Module 5: CI/CD and Application Deployment
- **Continuous Integration/Delivery**:
  - Configured GitHub Actions workflows to lint and validate Python and JavaScript code.
  - Used ESLint and Flake8 for automated code quality checks, fixing over 200 errors.
- **Containerization and Deployment**:
  - Built Docker images for the application and pushed them to a container registry.
  - Deployed the application on Kubernetes using a `deployment.yaml` file.
  - Verified the deployment and ensured scalability across cloud resources.
